"""Rich console helpers for copy/pasteable scripts.

Every path emitted by the sprite tooling should be printed through these
helpers so terminals that support Rich links expose it as an easy-to-open
``file://`` link.  The displayed text intentionally remains the original path
shape supplied by the caller, while the link target is absolute.
