    """**Where every part of one form belongs, derived rather than authored.**

    ⭐⭐ **why this exists.** The art was written as one drawing at one size:
    heads, hands, buttons, sleeves, shoe highlights and fasteners all carried
    absolute offsets that happened to agree at the proportions they were drawn
    for. Re-proportioning broke that agreement one part at a time — SEVEN
    separate "X doesn't follow the body" defects in a single session, each found
    only by looking at a render — because nothing stated where anything belonged.

    A rig is that statement. Parts hang off ANCHORS and the anchors are computed
    from the form's own authored sizes, so changing a size moves everything
    together by construction rather than by remembering.

    ⚠ **it reproduces the GROWN form exactly, and deliberately moves the short
    one.** The fractions are solved from the grown form, which Jon approved, so
    migrating a pose onto the rig leaves it byte-identical — verified frame by
    frame against a control render: every one of its own animations matches, and
    the only grown frames that differ are the two transform rows that host SHORT
    frames on the tall sheet.

    The short form moves because the hand nudges it accumulated were CORRECTIONS
    for the grown form's absolute offsets landing on a torso half the width.
    Under the rig those nudges double-count — `leg_dx = -0.833` dragged her feet
    out from under her — so they are zeroed where the rig now does the work.

    - `body_top` / `body_left` / `hip_y` come from the POSE. They already carry
      crouch, lean and bob, so anchors ride along with a leaning or crouching
      body for free.
    - the FRACTIONS multiply the form's **authored** `body_height` / `body_width`
      — never the pose's momentarily-narrowed crouch width. The drawing has
      always placed shoulders at a fixed offset from the torso corner, so
      scaling them by a squashed width moves an arm that used to hold still.

    ⇒ two earlier attempts got this backwards. Deriving the hip from the form
    alone dropped crouch entirely (14,780 pixels moved on the approved grown
    form); scaling x by the crouched width moved every skid and crouch frame.
    Both rendered fine at a glance and were caught only by differencing against
    a control render.

    ⭐ so migrating a pose onto this rig is **pixel-identical by construction**:
    every anchor is still `body_left + k` and `body_top + k`, with `k` now
