"""Shared plumbing for the hand-held weapon props (axe / javelin / bow /
arrow).

These targets all share the same authoring contract:

- The art is drawn **axis-aligned with the business end pointing RIGHT
  (+X)**. The game pins the prop to a character's hand at the ``grip``
  anchor and rotates the whole sprite to face the swing / aim / throw
  direction at runtime, so we never bake rotation frames into the
  sheet (same convention the laser-sword family uses — see
  ``_lasersword_common.py``).
- Each frame is drawn on a supersampled canvas (``SUPER`` × the final
  size) and LANCZOS-downsampled, which folds the anti-aliasing away
  without changing the output pixel count.
- Per-frame ``anchors`` (``grip`` / ``tip`` / …) are reported in
  **final-frame design pixels**. ``build_sheet``'s auto-crop pass
  translates those anchors by the crop offset for us, so we just
  report them in the pre-crop canvas frame and let the builder keep
  them correct.

This module is intentionally only the *plumbing* — the colour palette,
the supersample canvas helpers, and the anchor-meta builder. The
silhouette of each weapon lives next to that weapon's ``render()`` so
each prop stays legible on its own.
